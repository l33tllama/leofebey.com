# Electronics
I have been interested in electronics since I was about 6 years old. My parents bought me several kits, which I assembled. And I have soldered kits before I was 10. I'm particularly skilled with the Arduino platform. But I also know AVR, XMega, STM32, ESP430.

## Examples of work
* CSIRO GPS tracker - I programmed the chip and designed the circuit board
* Arduino robotics - I made an obstacle-avoidance robot
* Raspberry Pi telepresence robot - As featured in my projects
* LED strober - Flashes LED strips at different frequencies. Bluetooth control. 

## Pricing
I am fairly relaxed with pricing, due to low competition. Pricing is negotiable, depending on the project.
Base rate:
**$50 per hour** (plus electronics costs)
