# Programming and Software Development
I can develop software, systems and apps for people.  
My strongest programming skills are for Python, C and Javascript. I have written several successful programs in Python, and working on a game in C has made me master the language. My long experience with web development has made me good at Javascript.  
I have a particular strength in embedded systems (Python, Linux).

#### However I also have experience working in other languages:
* C# - Unity, University studies, small projects (Classes, C# features)
* Java - Hobby game engine work (Classes, IDEs)
* C++ - University projects (C++99)
* lua - Game development with Love2D (Including OOP)
* Kotlin - started learnin on Udemy
* Markdown - Blogging
* Twig - Grav templates

## Platforms Supported
* Windows
* Linux
* Android
* Web
* iOS (via cross-platfrom framework)
* MacOS (via cross-platform framework)

Due to my **current lack of Apple devices**, I am not best suited for Mac and iOS development. I'm **hoping to get more work** so that I can afford and buy a cheap Mac and iPad! You could also provide me with some Apple hardware if you have them.

For mobile development, I'd likely be using Flutter, Ionic or React Mobile. Which can be developed on any platform and deployed to iOS later. 

## Hourly Rate
My hourly rate varies greatly depending on the project.

### Minimum rate **$50 per hour**
For simple projects, like small Python scripts

### Average rate **$70 per hour**
For most longer-term projects, like the West Coast Railway camera system (Python, Linux, Web)

## Known Frameworks and Libraries
* Python Flask
* Python threading
* Python SQLite
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* C Standard libraries
* Python standard libraries
* Ionic mobile
* socket.io (Websockets)
* And numerous small labraries that are suited for each project 



## Linux environment
I've been using Linux on the desktop for a few years, and have worked with servers a fair bit.
* SSH
* System.d (create new system service)
* Bash
* Cron
* Init.d
* Ubuntu, Fedora, Centos, Arch, OpenSUSE, Debian package managers
* Screen
* Static IP confifuration
* Ubuntu Firewall (ufw)
* rsync

## Windows environment (current development OS)
Now with Windows Subsystem for Linux, I do a lot of development with that. I also use PyCharm Professional with remote SSH systems.
I find that Windows can be a very capable OS for developing a broad range of programs and systems. There are however still times that I need use a Linux virtual machine, or a real Linux machine. 
For example, I've used Windows to develop a cross-platform game with C, develop Python programs that run on remote systems, web development with SFTP filesystems, write Python GUI applications. Though Virtual machines are useful for testing integrated systems and testing Linux graphical applications such as games.

## Other Technologies
* OpenVPN (generate .ovpn files for connecting to a VPN)
* Microsoft Azure
* Proxmox virtual machine server
* Git, Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc
* Nextcloud administration

## Databases and data formats
* SQLite
* JSON
* SQL - MySQL and PostgreSQL
* MongoDB
