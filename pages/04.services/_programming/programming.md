# Programming
My strongest programming skills are for Python, C and Javascruot. I have written several successful programs in Python, and working on a game in C has made me master the language. My long experience with web development has made me good at Javascript.

#### However I also have experience working in other languages:
* C# - Unity, University studies, small projects
* Java - Hobby game engine work
* C++ - University projects
* lua - Game development with Love2D
* Kotlin - started learnin on Udemy
