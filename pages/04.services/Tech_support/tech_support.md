# Tech Support
I offer technical assistance in the home, or for businesses. I have strong familiarity with Windows OS and computer hardware. I'm pretty good at making sure computers run well, work with peripherals such as printers, connect to networks. If you're struggling with IT, I may be of assitance!

## Examples
* Speed up your computer
* Install hardware (like printers, hard drives, etc)
* Build computers from parts (cheaper than prebuilt systems)
* Remove spyware, viruses
* Improve your computer security (safer browsing, anti virus, etc)
* Set up networks and connect devices
* Set up broadband and NBN (after receiving hardware)
* Help you choose new software and use it (to some extent)
* Install Linux on older systems (eg. that can't run Windows 10) to get more use out of hardware

## Pricing
**$40 per half-hour**  

My rate is mostly fixed, but I do offer some exceptions depending on the work (like if it only takes me 5 minutes).  
Charged by half-hour blocks

## Guarantee
If I can't fix it, there is no charge. I take full responsibility for your tech.

## Macs
I don't own Macs and I don't use them regularly. However I have used them in the past (a few years ago) an I am very confident that I can use one if needed.  
Typically, not a lot goes wrong with Macs, so they aren't as much in demand. But my affinity for technology naturally extends to Macs, so I'm sure I can help.
