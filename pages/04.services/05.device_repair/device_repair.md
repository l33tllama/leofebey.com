# Device Repair

I have very good experience taking apart electronic devices such as phones, tablets, laptops. I have been disassembling devices since a young age. I have successfully repaired numerous devices.

## Examples
* Cracked screen - I can carefully remove it (various methods) and replace it  - estimated cost $200-300
* Worn out ports - I can remove the port (such as USB, headphone, power) and replace it - estimated cost $100-200
* Worn out battery - Extend the life of your phone/tablet/laptop. I can replace most batteries - estimated cost $100-200
* Microphone or speaker issues - Typically these can be replaced*1 - estimated cost $125-250
* Laptop keys missing - It's very possible that a replacement keyboard exists - estimated cost $100-200
* Touchpad cracked, not working - There may be a replacement touchpad for some models - estimated cost $125-200
* Device not working - possible faulty logic board - replacement price varies from $200-1000+

****Note*** - New parts take time to order in. I do not keep stock of parts (too many!). Typical wait time for components ranges from 1-4 weeks.


## Some things I (probably) can't do
* Apple Butterfly keyboard replacement - may be cheaper to get it fixed through Apple, as the whole chassis needs to be replaced! (Bad design)
* Resolder components such as ICs - This is very tricky work that I'm not well set up to do
* Water damage repair - It's likely beyond repair :( 
* Some Macbook servicing - There are some common faults on Macbooks that I am not set up to handle. See your Mac store. But I still may be an option in some cases.

*1 - Some Apple iPhones make microphone replacement break fingerprint reader as it is one module and fingerprint readers are device-locked :(  
*Another note is that some older, more obscure devices may not have replacement parts available online. But it's still worth asking just in case.
