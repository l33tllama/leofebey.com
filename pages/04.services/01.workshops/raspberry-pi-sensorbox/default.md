### The sensor box consists of:
#### BME680 Environment Sensot
* Air Pressure (hPA)
* Temperature (-40C to 85C)
* Humidity- 0% to 100%
* Air quality (CO2, etc) 

#### Ambient light sensor
* VEML6030

#### Sound sensor
* Electret microphone with amplifier
  
You can store the box at home and monitor various readings throughout the day. The sensor values will be sent to the Internet, so you can see it from anywhere!
