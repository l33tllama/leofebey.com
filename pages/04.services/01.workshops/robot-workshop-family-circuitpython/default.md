# Family Robot Workshop - CircuitPython / MakeBlocks
![](LeosWorkshops-small.png)  
  
This 2020/2021 school holidays, I will be running a robotics workshop for kids and parents!

The key difference about this robotics workshop is that you will build a real robot with real electronics components, and also learn Python (or MakeBlocks if you prefer).

I ran this workshop earlier in the year for people of all ages, and it was very successful!

## The Robot

## The robot consists of a  
### Robot chassis (you build yourself)

### CircuitPython microcontroller board (Adafruit Metro M0/M4 Express)

### Motor controller (powers the motors)

## Python
You will learn some simple Python programming. An example:
```Python
import time
time.sleep(2)
print("Hello World!")
```
