# Robot Workshop - CircuitPython

## About
This workshop first ran on 5 July 2020 at Enterprize Hobart. It covered building and programming a Python robot with an ulltrasonic sensor that avoids obstacles.  
It was a successful workshop! All participants built their robots and programmed them. I receieved good feedback.  
The cost of the workshop was arount $180 including parts and workshop fee.  
I may run another of this workshop in the future, but the next workshop after this will likely cover a different topic.
