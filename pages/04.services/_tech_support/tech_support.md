# Tech Support
I offer technical assistance in the home, or for businesses. I have strong familiarity with Windows and computer hardware. I know a bit about Macs, I'm pretty confident I can work with them if needed. I have my whole life of experience using PCs, and making them work well.

## Examples
* Speed up your computer
* Install hardware (like printers, hard drives, etc)
* Build computers from parts (cheaper than prebuilt systems)
* Remove spyware, viruses
* Improve your computer security (safer browsing, anti virus, etc)
* Set up networks and connect devices
* Set up broadband and NBN (after receiving hardware)
* Help you choose new software and use it (to some extent)

## Pricing
My rate is mostly fixed, but I do offer some exceptions depending on the work (like if it only takes me 5 minutes).
Charged by half-hour blocks
Rate: **$40 per half hour**

## Guarantee
If I can't fix it, there is no charge. I take full responsibility for your tech.
