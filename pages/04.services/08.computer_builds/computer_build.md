# Custom Build PCs

Building PCs is one of my greatest passions. I have built many PCs since I first got the opportunity to do so as a teenager. 

I can build you a computer that is much cheaper than a prebuilt machine like Dell, Alienware, HP, etc.

**I can build a PC to fit your budget.**

My custom-built PCs quotes are cheaper than the competition!

I charge **$50-150** depending on the complexity of the build.

It doesn't matter if you're after a basic office PC, or a decked-out high-end gaming PC. I can build it. I can also offer assistance in chosing parts.

Contact me to discuss building your next PC!

PS. If you're after a laptop, I know of good places to look and can help find a good (or one of the best) deal.
