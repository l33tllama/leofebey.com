# How I Choose Games to Play when I have over 1000 games on Steam
Embarassingly, but also inevitably, I have quite a few games on Steam. Let's just say over 1000. It happens. I created my Steam account in 2005! Many moons ago. And have been following all the Steam sales and other sources of cheap Steam games over the years (Humble, Greenmangaming, cjs-cdkeys, etc). As such, I have accumulated many games in my library. I guess it's the thing that I collect the most, Steam games.  
I can imagine that other people of a similar age to me (30s) may have also acquired a few games over the years, and would likely be lead to decision paralysis that can occur when looking at their Steam library when deciding on the next big (or small) game to commit to next. Am I right?  
It's taken me a while of attempting to solve this problem over the years, making good use of Steam library categories, my to-do list app (Todoist) for example. But oddly I've found a simpler way to pick games than that.  

## Lists
I've created two big lists of games.  
One, which is ***the games to try out for a short while*** (about 15 minutes or so). Games that I haven't played before but are on the big long list of shame of unplayed games. I play them for a little bit to see if they're something I want to commit to for a few weeks or months to see the game into completion. It's also a good way to scrape through your Steam library and see what all these games you've bought are like.  

The other list, which is the ***list of games to commit to and play fully through to completion***.  These are the games that I'm fully committed to completing, no matter how long it takes (pending game-breaking bugs of course).  
For example, right now I have:  
- [x] Entropy : Zero
- [x] Half-Life Alyx
- [x] Entropy : Zero 2
- [ ] Duke Nukem Forever (now playing)
- [ ] Serious Sam 2
- [ ] Red Matter (VR)
- [ ] Horizon Zero Dawn
- [ ] Paradigm
- [ ] We Happy Few
etc  

### List management
For convenience, I'm using SimpleNote to store these lists in a convenient way that I can access on any device. But you could use anything you want.  

### Results
Since trying this idea out, and committing to it, I've found I've been getting through my games a bit quicker than before, considering that I really only play single-player games one day per week these days on average. I know I have because I've been keeping track of my completed games on Todoist (which didn't quite work out for tracking these games due to the larger UI and difficulty in re-ordering the lists quickly).
