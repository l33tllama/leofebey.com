# Welcome to my blog!

Hello and welcome to my blog and website!

I've finally moved over to a CMS (Content management system) where I can more easily add content about the cool stuff that I do, like electronics, robotics, games, web, etc.

In this site, you'll find;

Obviously the **home page** - about me and my services

**Portfolio** - my past projects

**Current Projects** - Projects that I'm currently working on, all the media congregated into one place

**Blog** - this section - where I post updates on my projects and other stuff

**Resume** - Also a Markdown file so I can export it for job applications

**Social Media** - some of the social media sites that I have a profile for

I aim to have an RSS feed so you can subscribe to it but that is to come, stay tuned.

You'll find my posts on social media as well.

Looking forward to posting cool stuff!

Leo.
