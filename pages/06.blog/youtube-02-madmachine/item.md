# YouTube Project Series Video 02 - MadMachine SwiftIO Showcase
[plugin:youtube](https://youtu.be/pX1bvjG6Myo)  
My second YouTube video! As I planned, making a (roughly) monthly YouTube video about an electronics project or similar thing. In the second video, it is not a project but more of a showcase of the MadMachine SwiftIO development board - which is currently in development and is being given to some people for testing. It was my entry into programming in Swift and I have picked it up quickly. A cool little board that currently has limited uses but may have some exciting practical uses in the future.
