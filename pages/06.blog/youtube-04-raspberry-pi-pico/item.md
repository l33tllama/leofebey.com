My fourth (major) YouTube video! Really sorry abou the delay with this one. Life has been very busy, but I'm not stopping making videos!
This video shows a basic demo of the Raspberry Pi Pico, using MicroPython and Thonny IDE.
It makes an LED change colour, display values on an LCD, using buttons and a potentiometer.  

The video also shows a brief explanation of how the code works.  

A simple one this time, but more videos coming eventually!
