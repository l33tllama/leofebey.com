## Soundiiz Playlist Generator

Takes a playlist generated with Soundiiz (Online music platform manager tool) and then takes your existing music collection and generates a playlist file so that you can use your own music instead of a streaming service.

## High Bitrate Music Filter / Mover

Copies only high bitrate music from an existing collection into another folder. Useful from removing junk files that are low quality (eg. 128kbps).
