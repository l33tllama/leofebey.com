# Robot Workshop - CircuitPython (beta)

This is my first public workshop! Doesn't mean that it won't be any good :P 
I have taught children how to use the Godot Engine and I have years of experience helping people face to face, so I should be able to bring that experience to this.

My plan is to teach Python and basic robotics using [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) and a compatible development board eg the Adafruit M0 or M4 Express.

You'll be able to build your own robot, program it and take it home.

I'm aiming to target this workshop at people who have limited programming skills but want to learn a bit more. More advanced workshops will likely come in the future!
