# Minecraft World Backup

![](Minecraft_Block.png)

I'm currently working on a Python script that will back up a Minecraft world to disk. Without needing to install a plugin for Spigot/Bukkit. IT assumes you have Minecraft server running in a screen session.

I can't seem to find many (good) solutions to world backup out there, so I'm making my own.
